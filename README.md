# Weather Forecast

# Project Description

Using a third-party API from OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) I was able to create a basic weather dashboard that featured dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This weather dashboard allows users to input request for a cities current weather as well as featuring a five day forecast. Users requests are then saved in localStorage for future reference.

Requirements were as follows:

  1. To create a weather dashboard with form inputs that would respond to the user's search request.
  
  2. When a user would search for a city they would be given the weather for the current day as well as the weather for the next five days.
  
  3. The weather dashboard would feature a UV Index which colors would correspond with the current weather conditions.
  
  4. Users search request would be saved in localStorage for future reference.
